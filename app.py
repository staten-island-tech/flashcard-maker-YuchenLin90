# You will be creating an application that has two modes. You will leverage
# classes in Python to accomplish the tasks. You will be penalized for
# unnecessary code if you replicate features that already exist in Python.

# Teacher Mode

# In teacher mode you will be asking the user to input a word/phrase and the
# answer as a key:value pair. You can also attach an image. These pairs will
# be written to a json file called FlashCards.json.

# Student Mode
# In student mode you will present the student with the
# phrases/words/images and the user will type the answer in the terminal.
# Keep a tally of correct answers and provide a score. Give students bonus
# points for â€œStreaks.
